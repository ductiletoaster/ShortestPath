# ShortestPath
Find the best path through a matrix with Coordinates x,y,z with the best path being that which has the lowest z sum.

This is still a work in progress. However, the ShortestPathCPP will compile as a standalone project. 
Main.cpp contains some simple tests to show off the performance increase of a multi-threaded approuch vs a std sequential version.

### Requirements
- Visual Studio 2013
- CUDA 7.5 or later with VS integration
- CUDA capable video card (Tested with GTX 960)
